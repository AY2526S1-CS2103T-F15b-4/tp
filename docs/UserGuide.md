--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Command Formats

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Command keywords are case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. both `delete_person 2` and `DELETE_Person 2` are acceptable.

* Some commands have both a short keyword version and a long keyword version.<br>
  e.g. `delete_person 2` and `deletep 2` are the same command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add_person n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_person n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Listing and Finding

### Listing all clubs and contacts: `list` 

Simply lists every club and person you have saved in ClubHub.

### Finding persons: `find_person` (or `findp`)

Finds and displays persons (in the right list) that match all search conditions specified within the command.
If no condition is provided, `find_person` displays all persons. Possible search conditions include:
* `n/` - by name
* `a/` - by address
* `e/` - by email
* `p/` - by phone
* `t/` - by tag
* `s/` - by membership status

Each search condition is to be supplied with one or more search keywords.

**Format: `find_person [SEARCH_CONDITION SEARCH_KEYWORDS]...`**

<br>**Basic Usage: Finding by single field**

The find_person command can be used to locate persons using their basic fields, such as their name, address, email,
phone and tags. To do so, use the matching search condition (as displayed in the previous section) followed
by the keyword you wish to match for that condition (e.g. `findc n/ John`). **Do note that there should be
a space before each search condition or keyword.**

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
‚ÑπÔ∏è Info:  
Can't remember the exact value of the field? Not to worry, find matches keywords by substrings and is case-insensitive,
meaning that calling "findp n/ john" will return persons with names like "John" and "johnathan lee".
</div>

<br>**Advanced Usage: Supplying multiple keywords**

Each search condition may be supplied with multiple keywords, **any of** which may be used to match the target. For
example, `findp n/ Lee Li` would return persons with names like "Jane Li" and "Lee Richard".

<br>**Advanced Usage: Supplying multiple conditions**

Each command may also be supplied with multiple search conditions. However, unlike the case with keywords,
**all conditions** must match the target. For example, `findp t/ friend n/ John n/ Lee` will only return persons
tagged with "friend" whose names contain both "John" and "Lee".

<br>**Advanced Usage: Finding by membership status**

The find_club command can be used to locate persons with memberships of a particular status, such as persons with
expired memberships. To do so, use the `s/` condition, **but only with the following keywords:**
* `a` - for active memberships
* `e` - for expired memberships
* `p` - for memberships pending cancellation
* `c` - for canceled memberships

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: 
Unlike other search conditions, "s/" matches all identifiable keywords within a single string of letters.
This means that "findp s/ active" will return all active, expired and canceled members, since the keywords
"a", "c", and "e" are all present.
</div>

<br>**Command examples:**
* `findp` displays all persons
* `findp n/ Alex` displays `alex` and `Alex yeoh`
* `findp n/ alex david` displays `alex` and `Alex yeoh` and `David Li`
* `findp n/ alex n/ Yeoh` displays `Alex yeoh`
* `findp n/ Alex t/ friend` displays only `Alex yeoh` because `Alex yeoh` is tagged with `friend` but `alex` is not <br>
  ![result for 'findp n/ Alex t/ friend'](images/findAlexFriendResult.png)
  
<br>

### Finding clubs: `find_club` (or `findc`)

Finds and displays clubs (in the left list) that match all search conditions specified within the command.
If no condition is provided, `find_club` displays all clubs. Possible search conditions include:
* `n/` - by name
* `a/` - by address
* `e/` - by email
* `p/` - by phone
* `t/` - by tag
* `s/` - by membership status

Each search condition is to be supplied with one or more search keywords.

**Format: `find_club [SEARCH_CONDITION SEARCH_KEYWORDS]...`**

<br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
‚ÑπÔ∏è Info:  
The find_club command is identical to the find_person command in its usage, the only difference being that it
searches for clubs rather than persons. Hence, you may refer to the find_person command above for detailed guidance 
on its usage.
</div>

<br>**Command examples**

Here are some sample commands:
* `findc` displays all clubs
* `findc n/ Study` displays `study` and `Monday Study`
* `findc n/ Monday study` displays `study` and `Monday Study` and `Monday Guitar`
* `findc n/ Monday n/ study` displays `Monday Study`
* `findc n/ Study t/ 8pm` displays only `study` because `study` is tagged with `8pm` but `Monday Study` is not <br>
  ![result for 'findc n/ Study t/ NTU'](images/findStudyNtuResult.png)
  
<br>

### Displaying a person and their associated clubs : `membership_person` (or `mp`)

Finds and displays a person and the clubs which they are a member of. By default, displays all clubs where the person has a non-canceled membership. Any number of optional conditions may be provided to specify (by status) which memberships and their associated clubs are to be displayed. Conditions include:

ClubE, one pending cancellation with ClubP, and a canceled one with ClubC.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClubHub home folder.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
