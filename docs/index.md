**ClubHub is a program that allows users to manage clubs, allowing them to assign contacts to multiple clubs.** The user is greeted with an interface with two halves: a list for clubs on the left and one for contacts on the right. Using the CLI, the user can execute commands.

* If you are interested in using ClubHub, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing ClubHub, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
